# Cherry Blossom Biome Research Website Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach**: Drawing inspiration from premium educational and nature tourism websites like National Geographic, BBC Earth, and premium Japanese tourism sites. This approach emphasizes visual storytelling and immersive content presentation suitable for an educational research project.

## Core Design Elements

### Color Palette

**Accent Colors:**
- Fresh green (120 40% 60%) for foliage elements
- Subtle gold (45 35% 75%) for cultural/historical sections

### Typography
- **Primary Font**: Inter (Google Fonts) - clean, readable for research content
- **Accent Font**: Noto Serif JP (Google Fonts) - for Japanese cultural elements and headings
- **Hierarchy**: h1 (2.5rem), h2 (2rem), h3 (1.5rem), body (1rem), small (0.875rem)

### Layout System
**Spacing Units**: Tailwind units of 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 (p-4, m-6, h-8, gap-12, etc.)

### Component Library

**Navigation**
- Clean horizontal navigation with subtle cherry blossom icon
- Sticky header with transparent background blur
- Mobile-responsive hamburger menu

**Content Sections**
- Hero section with full-width cherry blossom imagery
- Research cards with rounded corners and subtle shadows
- Information panels with pink accent borders
- Image galleries with lightbox functionality

**Interactive Elements**
- Outline buttons with blurred backgrounds when over images
- Smooth scroll navigation between sections
- Expandable content sections for detailed research

**Data Displays**

**Image Treatment**: Soft, natural photography with consistent warm color grading. All images should feel cohesive and educational while maintaining visual appeal.

## Page Structure
- **Single-page application** with smooth scroll navigation
- **5 main sections**: Research Overview, Ecosystem Details, Cultural Impact, Conservation, Tourism & References
- Each section uses the 4-6-8-12-16 spacing system for consistent vertical rhythm
- Content organized in digestible chunks with clear visual hierarchy

## Special Considerations
- Educational tone balanced with visual appeal
- Research credibility through clean, professional presentation
- Cultural sensitivity in representing Japanese cherry blossom traditions
- Mobile-first responsive design for accessibility
- Subtle animations limited to scroll reveals and hover states
